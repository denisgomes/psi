Overview
========

At its core, PSI is a finite element analysis program which allows users to
model complex piping systems subjected to a variety of loads and loading
conditions.

The general process is as follows:

1. Model the piping system using various piping components such as runs, bends
   valves, flanges, etc.

2. Apply boundary conditions, such as anchors, linestops and guides.

3. Apply deadweight, thermal and fluid loadings, just to name a few.

4. Solve the computer model for static, modal, harmonic and time history type
   loadings, and finally,

5. Post-process the results to gain valuable insight and to drive design
   decisions.
