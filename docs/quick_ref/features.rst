Community Edition
-----------------

The Community Edition of PSI is feature packed and capable of solving a wide
variety of different piping problems. The following is a list of its primary
capabilities:

* Modeling of major piping components such as Runs, Bends, Reducers, Valves,
  and Flanges.
* Ability to specify section and material data properties for different
  cross-sections.
* Access to a variety of different support types including Anchors, GlobalX,
  GlobalY, and GlobalZ.
* Non-linear support capability *excluding* gaps and friction
* Assign loads such as Weight, Pressure, Thermal, Wind and Seismic among
  others.
* Static linear analysis of loadcases and combinations.
* Stress evaluation based on B31.1 piping code.
* Movements, support reactions and internal force results.
* Much more to come...


Enterprise Edition
------------------

All the features available in the Community Edition of PSI are included in the
Enterprise edition by default. In addition, the features listed below are only
available with the upgraded version.

* Access to all element types, such as bellows.
* Comprehensive section and material database.
* Valve and flange weight database.
* Support gaps and friction.
* Support for additional codes and standards.
* Dynamic modal, response spectrum and time history analysis.
* Trunnion analysis.
* Nozzle evaluation.
* Much more to come...

In addition, the Enterprise Edition is subjected to rigorous verification and
validation, going far above and beyond the Tier 1 textbook examples employed
for the Community Edition. A 3-tier approach is used to throughly benchmark the
software for a variety of different test cases.

.. note::

    The Enterprise Edition is a work in progress. To learn more about it's
