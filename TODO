=====

Supports
--------
*Debug inclined supports
*Make imposed support displacment opercase dependent (solver.py)
*Refactor support.py, change GlobalX to X, etc
*Implement spring supports and refactor supports.py
*Update support apply method
*Implement fglobal for supports.
*Implement support displacement.
*Fix LineStop and Guide Supports directions. Support direction cosine, function
or property?
*Should supports have element reference?
*Guide support should be pointed in the vertical direction.

Elements
--------
*Implement bend and reducer element type
*Implement sifs for various components, especially for tees
*Implement tee element stiffness
*Remove dependence on topology.py

Loads
-----
*Fix thermal load internal force reaction report, should be 0 if not restrained
axially
*Distinguish betweeen Nodal displacement (loads.Displacement). Be able to
apply a displacement to a support.

Loadcase

1. Implement support prescribed displacement for nonlinear suppports.
2. Refactor with fglobal for supports.

Tests
-----
*Test loads
*Test supports
*Test piping components

Docs
----
