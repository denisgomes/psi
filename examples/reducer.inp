"""Simple analysis of a reducer element.

A reducer is approximated using an internal straight bezier curve. The solver
performs a preprocess step where additional internal elements with reducing
element diameters are created for each reducer during runtime to apprixmate the
reducer geometry. The number of internal elements are based on an user defined
setting.
